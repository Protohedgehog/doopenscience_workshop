# food for thoughts

check the openscienceskills document (another github repo of J colomb)

# Audience

PhD students with no coding skills ?

# Timing

Goal is to set the workshop up for end of mai and do it middle of June


#Topics

1. Version control (git)
2. Documenting (markdown)
3. Metadata and standards


#how

- Getting contest (best solution to a problem) via github fork and pull
- Work with participant private data with one survey before and one servey after the workshop: github to give the data (same standard), R to concatenate it and ggplot2 it!
- Maybe push it to Figshare ? Data is at the same time the content we work with and the presentation of the results of the workshop.
